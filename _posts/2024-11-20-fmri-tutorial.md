Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) is a powerful tool for studying brain activity. This tutorial will walk you through the basics of analyzing fMRI data.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:

- Basic knowledge of neuroscience
- Familiarity with Python or MATLAB
- Access to fMRI analysis software (e.g., SPM, FSL, or AFNI)

## Step 1: Data Preprocessing

The first step in fMRI analysis is preprocessing your data. This typically includes:

1. **Slice timing correction**: Correcting for the time difference in acquisition of different slices
2. **Motion correction**: Realigning images to correct for head movement
3. **Spatial normalization**: Transforming images to a standard space
4. **Smoothing**: Applying a Gaussian filter to improve signal-to-noise ratio

## Step 2: Statistical Analysis

After preprocessing, you can perform statistical analysis to identify brain regions that show significant activation during your task.

## Next Steps

In future tutorials, we'll dive deeper into advanced analysis techniques including connectivity analysis and multi-voxel pattern analysis (MVPA).
